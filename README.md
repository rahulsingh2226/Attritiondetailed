Employee Attrition Prediction - Detailed Modeling
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and modeling process to predict employee attrition using machine learning. The notebook explores various techniques and models to identify patterns in workforce data that contribute to employee churn.

üìò Notebook Overview
File: AttritionDetailedmodel.ipynb

Number of Code Cells: 60

Number of Markdown Cells: 4

Includes model tuning and hyperparameter exploration

Focused on predictive modeling using classification techniques

üîç Objective
To develop a robust machine learning model that can predict whether an employee will leave the organization (attrition) based on historical HR data.

üß∞ Tools & Libraries
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation

Pickle for model serialization

üß™ Modeling Techniques
Decision Tree Classifier (with hyperparameter tuning)

Train-Test split and model validation

Performance evaluation using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

F1 Score

Precision & Recall

üìä Data Insights
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploration of categorical and numerical feature impacts

Label encoding for categorical variables

üóÇÔ∏è Files
AttritionDetailedmodel.ipynb: Main notebook with end-to-end modeling process

Additional data and model files (e.g., .csv, .pkl) may need to be added separately

‚úÖ Status
This project is complete and ready for review, but can be extended by:

Adding ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

Including SHAP or LIME for model explainability

Deploying the model as a Flask or Streamlit app
